    question: 'What is the Streak feature?',
    answer: 'The Streak tracks your daily learning and activity progress visually over the last 182 days (about 6 months).',
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'How is my daily streak percentage calculated?',
    answer: `Each day, you earn streak percentage based on your activity:
  - Completed 1 module = 100%
  - Completed 50% of a module = 50%
  - Posted something useful = 25%
`,
  },
  {
    id: '3',
    question: 'What does each box in the streak grid represnet?',
    answer: `Each box = 1 day
Layout: 26 weeks (columns) x 7 days (rows) = 182 days
Colors or intensity of the boxes reflect your daily streak percentage. More completion = darker/more intense color.`,
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: 'Will I lose my streak if I skip a day?',
    answer: "Not exactly. Your streak isn't broken line in some apps. Even partial activity (like posting or completing 50% of a module) will count. You only get 0% if you do nothing on that day.",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "What is Streak Rate?",
    answer: `Streak Rate measures how consistently active you've been since joining the platform. It's a percentage score.
Streak Rate = (Total streak % across all days) / (Total days since joining)`,
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "What is 'Activities section'?",
    answer: `The Activities section shows all the action you've comleted on a specific day that contributed to your streak - not just today.

By default, it shows today's activity. You can chane the date to view your activities on any of the past 182 days.

Example entries:
  - Completed "Module 1: Introduction to AI"
  - Posted: "Best practices for clean code in Python`,
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "Why don't I see anything in Activities?",
    answer: "If you haven't done anything that contributes to your streak (course progress or a useful post), this section will be empty.",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "What is the Leaderboard?",
    answer: `The leaderboard ranks users based on their total points earned by:
  - Completing course modules
  - Completing project modules

It highlights top learners and creators in the community.`
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    question: "How are points calculated for the leaderboard?",
    answer: `Each completed module (course or project) gives you points.
More modules = More points = Higher rank.
(Note: Streak activity itself doesn't add leaderboard points unless it involves completing modules.)`,
  },
  {
    id: "10",
    question: "Does posting increase leaderboard rank?",
    answer: "No. Useful posts only help increase your daily streak, not your leaderboard rank."
